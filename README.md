# Tomato Transportation Routes Optimization Readme
## Objective
This optimization problem focuses on efficiently shipping tomato products from multiple plants to multiple destinations via transfer stations, considering bi-directional shipments among plants and destinations. The objectives include meeting demand, minimizing transshipment costs, and ensuring the validity of shipments along certain routes.

## Problem Description
The RedBrand Company operates three plants, two warehouses, and two customers. Shipments can occur directly from plants to customers or via warehouses. The problem involves determining the optimal shipping schedule to minimize costs while meeting demand and capacity constraints.

## Python Implementation
The optimization problem is implemented using the Gurobi Python Module and other Python libraries. The problem setup, including input parameters, decision variables, objective function, and constraints, is defined and solved using Python code.

## Result
After optimization, the optimal shipping schedule is obtained. The following are the key results:

The optimal quantity of tomato to be shipped from each node to each destination.
The total operating cost incurred for the optimal shipping schedule.
## Discussion
The optimized shipping schedule ensures that customer demand is met while respecting plant capacities and transit node constraints. By minimizing transshipment costs, RedBrand Company can efficiently distribute tomato products to customers, optimizing their logistics operations and potentially reducing overall costs.
